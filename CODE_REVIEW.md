   - `useWeatherData` - Manages weather data fetching with request cancellation and auto-refresh
   - `useLocationSearch` - Handles location search with debouncing and cancellation
   - `usePinnedLocations` - Manages pinned locations with localStorage persistence

2. **Loading Skeletons** - Added skeleton components and CSS animations:
   - `WeatherCardSkeleton` - Shows loading state for weather cards
   - `SearchResultSkeleton` - Shows loading state for search results
   - Shimmer animation effect for better perceived performance

3. **Request Cancellation** - Implemented AbortController for:
   - Weather data fetching to prevent race conditions
   - Location search queries to cancel outdated requests
   - Proper cleanup on component unmount

4. **ESLint & Prettier** - Added code quality tools:
   - ESLint configuration with TypeScript and React rules
   - Prettier for consistent code formatting
   - Scripts for linting and formatting in package.json

5. **Unit Tests** - Set up testing infrastructure:
   - Vitest configuration with React Testing Library
   - Comprehensive tests for weather utility functions
   - Test coverage for all weather condition mappings

6. **Environment Validation** - Added startup checks:
   - Validates required environment variables
   - Provides helpful error messages in development
   - Created `.env.example` file for easy setup

The application now has professional-grade tooling, testing, and error handling capabilities.

## Update: High Priority Tasks Completed ✅

The following high-priority improvements have been implemented:

1. **Component Extraction** - Split monolithic App.tsx into separate components:
   - `WeatherCard.tsx` - Main weather display component with React.memo optimization
   - `SearchBar.tsx` - Search functionality with input sanitization
   - `Header.tsx` - Application header with all controls
   - `ErrorBoundary.tsx` - Error handling wrapper component

2. **Utility Functions** - Extracted weather-related functions to `src/utils/weather.ts`:
   - Consolidated duplicate `getTimeOfDay` functions
   - Centralized weather condition and icon logic

3. **TypeScript Improvements** - Removed all `any` types and added proper interfaces

4. **Accessibility Enhancements**:
   - Added ARIA labels to all interactive elements
   - Implemented keyboard navigation for search results
   - Added role attributes for better screen reader support
   - Improved button semantics with aria-pressed states

5. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Implemented React.memo for WeatherCard component
   - Reduced re-renders through component separation

6. **Security & Validation**:
   - Added input sanitization for search queries (removes HTML tags)
   - Added max length constraint for search input

The App.tsx file has been reduced from 889 lines to 424 lines, improving maintainability significantly.

# Weather App Code Review

## Executive Summary

This code review covers the Weather Peek application, a React-based weather app built with TypeScript and Vite. The application allows users to search locations, view weather data, pin multiple locations, and offers a clean UI with theme support. Overall, the codebase is well-structured but has several areas for improvement regarding code organization, performance, accessibility, and security.

## Architecture Assessment

### Strengths
- Clear separation between API layer (`weatherApi.ts`) and UI components
- Well-defined TypeScript interfaces for data structures
- Consistent use of React hooks for state management
- Good use of CSS custom properties for theming

### Areas for Improvement
- Main `App.tsx` file is too large (889 lines) and handles too many responsibilities
- No component separation - everything is in one file
- Missing error boundaries for better error handling
- No unit tests or integration tests

## Code Quality Issues

### 1. Component Architecture

**Issue**: The entire application logic is in a single `App.tsx` file with 889 lines of code.

**Impact**: Poor maintainability, difficult to test, hard to understand and modify.

**Recommendation**: Break down into smaller, focused components:
- `WeatherCard` component (already exists but should be in separate file)
- `SearchBar` component
- `Header` component
- `LocationList` component
- Custom hooks for weather data management

### 2. Performance Concerns

**Issue**: Multiple performance inefficiencies:
- No memoization of expensive computations
- Inefficient re-renders due to object creation in render cycle
- No lazy loading for forecast data
- Missing React.memo for `WeatherCard` component

**Specific Examples**:
- `getWeatherCondition`, `getTemperatureClass`, `getTimeOfDay` functions called on every render
- Style objects created inline (line 427-430)
- No debouncing optimization for drag operations

### 3. Type Safety

**Issue**: Several TypeScript issues:
- Use of `any` type in multiple places (lines 20, 219, 53 in weatherApi.ts)
- Missing proper error types
- Weak typing for localStorage operations

### 4. Error Handling

**Issue**: Inadequate error handling throughout the application:
- Generic error messages don't help users understand issues
- No retry mechanisms for failed API calls
- Silent failures in localStorage operations
- No network status detection

### 5. Accessibility

**Issue**: Multiple accessibility concerns:
- Missing ARIA labels on interactive elements
- No keyboard navigation support for location list
- Poor color contrast in some weather conditions
- Missing screen reader announcements for dynamic content
- Tooltips not accessible via keyboard

### 6. Security Concerns

**Issue**: Potential security vulnerabilities:
- API key exposed in client-side code (though using environment variable)
- No input sanitization for search queries
- Direct DOM manipulation without sanitization
- No Content Security Policy headers

### 7. Code Duplication

**Issue**: Significant code duplication:
- `getTimeOfDay` and `getForecastTimeOfDay` are nearly identical (lines 63-100 and 103-140)
- Repeated temperature conversion logic
- Duplicated time parsing logic

### 8. State Management

**Issue**: Complex state management without proper patterns:
- 15+ useState hooks in main component
- No state normalization
- Prop drilling through multiple levels
- Missing state persistence for search results

### 9. API Integration

**Issue**: API layer could be improved:
- No request cancellation for outdated searches
- Missing request deduplication
- No caching strategy beyond in-memory storage
- Hard-coded API endpoints

### 10. CSS and Styling

**Issue**: CSS file is large and could be better organized:
- Over 1500 lines of CSS in a single file
- No CSS modules or styled components
- Potential for style conflicts
- Missing responsive design breakpoints

## Best Practices Not Followed

1. **No ESLint or Prettier configuration** - Code style inconsistencies
2. **Missing environment validation** - No checks for required env variables
3. **No loading skeletons** - Poor perceived performance
4. **Missing service worker** - No offline capability
5. **No analytics or monitoring** - Can't track user behavior or errors
6. **Hardcoded values** - Magic numbers throughout the code
7. **No internationalization** - English-only interface
8. **Missing meta tags** - Poor SEO and social sharing

## Positive Aspects

1. **Good TypeScript usage** - Most code is properly typed
2. **Modern React patterns** - Hooks used effectively
3. **Responsive design** - Works on mobile and desktop
4. **Clean UI** - Visually appealing interface
5. **Feature-rich** - Drag-and-drop, themes, temperature units
6. **Performance optimizations** - Debounced search, conditional rendering

## Recommendations Priority

### High Priority
1. Extract components into separate files
2. Implement proper error boundaries and handling
3. Add loading states and skeletons
4. Fix accessibility issues
5. Add input validation and sanitization

### Medium Priority
1. Implement proper state management (Context API or Redux)
2. Add comprehensive TypeScript types
3. Optimize performance with memoization
4. Add unit and integration tests
5. Implement proper caching strategy

### Low Priority
1. Add internationalization support
2. Implement PWA features
3. Add animations and transitions
4. Improve SEO with meta tags
5. Add user preferences sync

## Security Recommendations

1. Move API calls to a backend service
2. Implement rate limiting
3. Add input validation on all user inputs
4. Use Content Security Policy headers
5. Implement proper CORS handling

## Testing Strategy

Currently, there are no tests. Recommend implementing:
1. Unit tests for utility functions
2. Component tests with React Testing Library
3. Integration tests for API calls
4. E2E tests for critical user flows
5. Accessibility tests with axe-core

## Conclusion

The Weather Peek application has a solid foundation but needs significant refactoring to improve maintainability, performance, and user experience. The main priority should be breaking down the monolithic component structure and implementing proper error handling and testing.
